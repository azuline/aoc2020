# Advent of Code 2020

Primarily running with Rust, maybe I will write some Haskell or Python
solutions for fun.

Requires rust nightly (for day 6).

Run `./compare.sh` to compare the outputs of the Rust and Python solutions.
(Stopped writing Python solutions, so only up to a day 13.)

```sh
$ cargo run <day>
$ cabal run aoc2020 <day>
$ python src/day<day>.py
```
